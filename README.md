# Superblock Feasibility - GIS Visualizations

This repository contains visualizations created in QGIS to demonstrate proficiency in GIS spatial analysis and mapping, based on my original project analyzing the feasibility of Superblocks in Manhattan as a method to improve bike safety.

## Project Overview

The original project is a portion of a larger study on urban infrastructure, City of Bikes. It evaluated the potential of superblocks to improve bike safety in Manhattan.

* Integrated OpenStreetMap landuse and demographic data
* Assessed network connectivity using betweenness centrality and travel distance metrics
* Developed recommendations for improved urban design

  This original project used GeoPandas to create visualizations; this repository recreates a few of those figures in QGIS.

## Repository Contents

* `maps/` - Exported PDF maps generated in QGIS
